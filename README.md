# Income Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that outlines the development of a machine learning model to predict individual income levels based on various demographic and employment variables. The model aims to classify whether individuals earn above or below a certain income threshold, typically $50K. This kind of prediction can be useful for targeted marketing, policy making, and socioeconomic research.

## Features

The notebook `Income.ipynb` includes the following key sections:

- **Data Exploration**: Visualization and statistical analysis to understand the distribution of data and the relationship between different features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques applied to clean and prepare the data for modeling, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to train the income prediction model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model performance.
- **Prediction**: Using the model to make predictions on new data.

## Data

The data used in this project is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Adult dataset. It contains attributes like age, education, marital status, occupation, and hours per week with the target variable being the income class (<=50K or >50K).

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
